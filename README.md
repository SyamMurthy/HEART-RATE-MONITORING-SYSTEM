# HEART-RATE-MONITORING-SYSTEM

Heart rate monitors are devices that detect and measure your heart or pulse rate. This Heart Rate Moniter project consists of one Node MCU, one Pulse Sensor, one OLED Display, and one Bread Board. These devices are small, wearable and many use sensors that are very accurate. However, while these devices are excellent for personal use, they’re no substitute for medical devices that are much more accurate.
These devices use two different approaches:
The term "heart rate monitor" refers to devices that can detect either your heart rate or your pulse rate. Your pulse and heart rate are two different ways to track your heart’s activity. There’s usually no difference between your heart rate and your pulse rate. Your heart rate is how many times your heart beats per minute. Your pulse rate is how many times per minute your arteries expand because of your heart beating.
Electrical (electrocardiography): Your heart generates a small electrical current with every  heartbeat. Heart rate monitors with electrical detection capabilities can detect and track  that  current.
Optical (photoplethysmography): These  devices  use  infrared  light  to  see  the  expansion  of your arteries as your heart pumps blood through them. These devices track your pulse rate, and some can also estimate the oxygen levels in your blood.
